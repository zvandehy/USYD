IDEAS:
- Use Lazy Loading on Client
- Use Visitor Pattern for ContactHandler
- Make Report implement Comparable?
- Probably use Bridge pattern for Orders
- The only pattern I know to reduce RAM is flyweight, but I am not sure how to do that for Reports.
Does LazyLoading reduce RAM? I don't think LazyLoading is correct because the data will be loaded as soon
as the report is compared. I also need to understand better why reports are being compared.
