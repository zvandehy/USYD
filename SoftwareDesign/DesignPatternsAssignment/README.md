1'. Problem: Too much RAM from Reports
- Flyweight
- There is at least one copy of each report in the system
- Report could be the intrinsic state of an order

2'. So many types of orders
- Bridge...
- We abstract: (if ignore scheduled)
    - Depends on orderType (abstract it)
    - Depends on critical (abstract it)
    - Need to be creative to abstract scheduled
        - Without scheduled it looks like the regular bridge pattern
        - With scheduled, you need to be more creative
        
3'. Contact Handling
- Chain Of Responsability
- Need to Review this more

4'. Loading Clients from DB takes a long time (DONE)
- Lazy Loading
- I implemented Lazy Loading on the ClientImpl class by creating a map that tracks if a field has been loaded (true/false).
The constructor doesn't make any calls to the database. The database is called if a field is requested and it has not been loaded yet.
One concern: I am storing the AuthToken in the Client class. This doesn't break authentication because of how the tokens are handled (when the token is used, the system checks if it is still a valid token).

5'. Compare Equality of Reports without primary key (DONE)
- Value Object
- When you have an array, you want an immutable list
- Could use Hashcode as a field, and generate the hash when the value object is initialized
- Then in the equals(), we can check the hashcode, and if they are equal then check the equality. Otherwise, we know that they are different and we donâ€™t have to go through the pain of checking every value in each Array.

6'. Order Creation process has lots of lag
- Unit Of Work

7'. Multithreading
